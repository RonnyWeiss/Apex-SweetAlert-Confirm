This Dynamic Action Plug-in is used to validate with the help of an input whether the next steps of the dynamic action can be continued or not. If you want to delete a dataset, for example, you can use this plugin to make the user aware of what he/she wants to delete, in order to prevent a marked delete. The comparison value is simply loaded from a page item.
